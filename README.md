# LACITYzoning_points_section

Experimenting with QGIS and Three.js with the QGIS2THREE.JS plugin.

Created centroid points of all the zoning polygons in the city of Los Angeles and positioned them as cubes relative to the terrain elevation from a digital elevation model of the area.

The QGIS plugin generated a 3d model with an exaggerated terrain. A "sectional" view of the model produced an interesting look at zoning along a terrain. The camera coordinates and angles were saved and the view can be seen here.
